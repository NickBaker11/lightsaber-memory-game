# Lightsaber Memory Game

This website will be intervactive for the user through the use of a fun memory game that they can play.
It is based around a sequence of couloured 'lightsabers' which will activate (light up) and then deactivate, in a 
particular order. The user will then be required to memorise and then successfully copy the sequence by clicking
on the correct lightsaber. If the user follows the correct pattern then they will be successful and the next level 
be unlocked.

There will be additional intervactivity where the user can input their name which will be displayed whilst they
play. They will also be able to change between two background themes- Light or Dark Side. I intend to have aduio for
the activating/deactivating lightsabers and possibly background music.

## UX
This site is aimed at people who would like to play a simple memory game and may also have an interest in the Star Wars
universe.
The user will want to play the game and get a response as to whether they entered the correct sequence or if they
got it wrong.
## Features
* Theme choice- Clicking on ls-btn or ds-btn allows the user to choose a colour theme, either blue or red.
